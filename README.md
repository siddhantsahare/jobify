This is a Job Portal Website Named Jobify. It allows user to apply for the jobs they are interested in.

Jobify has followed the norms and design patterns of other Job portals like `freelancer.com` which encourages no to minimum usage of images in app.

I used no images in the app just to highlight attention on functionality mainly sorting and filtering and the code itself.

This project was possible with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Only Two Steps and you are good to go

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
